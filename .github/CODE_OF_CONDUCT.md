There is none—and there never will be. Contributors can follow their own personal code of conduct. Similar to real life!

There is, however, a strict repository dress code:

### Our Pledge

In the interest of promoting meritorious achievement, we now tailor the yardstick by which all Contributors shall be measured, to ensure that we are ever well-attired in the course of our noble and leet pursuits. Contributors shall at all relevant times dress as follows:

* Gentlemen: Black tailcoat, black patent leather shoes, white bow tie. No less. Pocket watches mandatory.

* Ladies: Floor-length formal gowns. Mid-calf unacceptable. Compulsory white gloves when composing issues or pull requests.

* Casual Fridays will permit tuxedos. On such days, cufflinks may be adorned with one of: Duke, Tiger, Mustang, or Dolphin. Substitution requests not entertained.

### Exponential Backoff Policy for Violations of the Contributor Code of Dress

There are punishments for failing to adhere to our exacting standards. Punishments shall be proportionate. In the event that a punishment is not proportionate, it shall be considered to be so anyway.

#### Premier Faux Pas

Mild admonishment. A polite DM from a repository jannie reminding you to don your gay apparel before engaging in coding activities. Expect gentle mockery for your oversight.

#### Second Wardrobe Malfunction

A formal warning, and you’ll be required to submit to your Regional Board of Jannies a JIRA ticket elucidating why you chose to abandon elegance. This is your opportunity to plead extenuating circumstances.

#### Third Shameful Display

A Letter of Reprimand. Also, you must pen a lengthy essay on the folly of waking up and choosing violation in lieu of stateliness.

#### Further Slovenliness

Any Response that is Deemed necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Mortification.

### We Hold the Value of Fanciness to Be Self-Evident

So as to best preserve and exalt the spirit of entretenir, instances of tawdry, ignoble, or otherwise unfancy dress may be reported by snitches via wax-sealed and handwritten letter, delivered to [you know the thing]. All complaints will be delved (yes, delved!) into and will result in a response befitting the instant contingency. The project team is obligated to maintain good humour, good software, and of course, fanciness.
